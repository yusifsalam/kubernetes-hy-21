# Project

This is a fullstack project that consists of a Node fastify backend and NextJS frontend.

Available routes:

1. `/`: create-next-app default page
1. `/image`: Random image of the day, a list of existing todos and a form to add a new one
1. `/api`: Static hello-world html served from the backend
1. `/api/todos`: GET endpoint returning JSON of todos
1. `/api/randomImage`: Image of the day returned from the backend

## Exercise 3.06: DBaaS vs DIY

### DBaaS:

Pros:

- quick and easy to get started
- vendor support
- easier maintenance
- automatic scaling and replication, backups

Cons:

- can get pricey real quick
- vendor lock-in

### DIY

Pros:

- is DIY
- probably cheaper
- complete control

Cons:

- takes more time to get started, do maintenance
- requires a lot more know-how
- no one else to blame if something goes wrong
- no automatic backups or scaling

## Exercise 3.07: Commitment

I chose DIY because it's cooler and I already have it implemented. Doing everything yourself also means you get to make all the possible mistakes and maybe even learn from them.
